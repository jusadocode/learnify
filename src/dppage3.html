      <h2>Introduction to Practical Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the third part of our Dynamic Programming series. In this section, we'll explore practical applications
        of dynamic programming through real-world examples and case studies.

      <h2>Case Study: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph</h2>
      <p>
        One practical application of dynamic programming is finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. We'll explore
        algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford to solve this problem efficiently.

        <pre>
          // Example of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path
          // Implementing this algorithm is left as an exercise for the reader
          function dijkstra(graph, startNode, endNode) {
            // Implementation goes here
          }
        </pre>

      <h2>Real-world Example: Dynamic Programming in Finance</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamic programming is widely used in finance for solving optimization problems, such as portfolio management
        and option pricing. We'll explore how dynamic programming can be applied to financial scenarios.
